What is a **virtual being** - a.k.a. a virtual influencer or a virtual YouTuber? With human sensing technology and real-time graphics combined, 
a new trend is rising among gen Z, layering digital reality over ours.

**Virtual beings**Â are computer models of people that can be used for embedding representations of 
created or re-created humans into virtual environments.
